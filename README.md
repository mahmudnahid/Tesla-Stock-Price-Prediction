## Tesla Stock Price Prediction
The project aims to analyze the historical stock prices of Tesla and predict future prices of the stock. Given the historical stock prices and other market data of Tesla, this project aims to develop a deep learning model that can accurately analyze and predict the future stock prices of Tesla. With significant advancements in deep learning (especially architectures and open-source deep learning libraries), it is possible to capture complex relationships and patterns in the data and make accurate predictions, even in the presence of noise and fluctuations in the market. As a part of the learning from this project, the aim is to infer the optimal combination of the machine learning models, architecture, dataset preprocessing, and evaluation method suitable for a time series problem with a focus on stock market analysis.

### The Dataset
The dataset was acquired from Kaggle ([TESLA Stock Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/tesla-stock-data-updated-till-28jun2021)). This dataset provides historical data on TESLA INC. stock (TSLA) for the past 12 years from June 2010 to March 2022. The data is available at a daily level. The currency is USD. 

## Setup
To run the code on your own machine, rather than using a managed notebook service like Colab, you will need to set up a development environment. ML and DL engineers should have some experience working with development environments, so it is beneficial to gain this skill beforehand.

**To set up the development environment on a local or remote machine, please follow the instructions in the setup folder's README.md file.**
